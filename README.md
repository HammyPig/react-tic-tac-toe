# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This project demonstrates my understanding of the fundamental concepts of React. It showcases the following features:

- Responsive flexbox layout for seamless play on any device
- Chess.com-inspired turn navigation with a satisfying dynamic control panel and player action grid
- Visual enhancements including icons, colour themes, and rounded corners
- Custom GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to GitHub Pages

This project began as a loose implementation of the [React Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), and evolved into a more advanced application with additional features and improved design.
